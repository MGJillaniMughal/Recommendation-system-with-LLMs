# Title: Implementing an LLM-Powered Recommendation System

# Description:
This project involves the development of a recommendation system powered by large language models (LLMs). The system is designed to analyze and process a dataset of anime, which includes various attributes such as titles, genres, and synopses.

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains multiple columns such as MAL_ID, Name, Score, Genres, and Synopsis. This data is processed to be utilized in the recommendation system.

# Functionality:

Data Preprocessing: The notebook begins with loading and preprocessing the anime dataset. This step includes cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis.
Recommendation Logic: The core of the notebook is the development of a recommendation algorithm. This section involves the use of LLMs to analyze the anime data and make recommendations based on user preferences or input criteria.
How to Run:
To run this notebook:

Ensure that Python and Jupyter Notebooks are installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.
# Note:
This project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the use of LLMs in building recommendation systems.
